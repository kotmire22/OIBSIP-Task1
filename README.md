Welcome to the House Price Prediction Project! This project uses machine learning algorithms to predict house prices based on various features. The goal is to build a predictive model that can estimate the price of a house given its attributes.
Accurately predicting house prices is crucial for various stakeholders in the real estate industry, including buyers, sellers, and investors. This project leverages machine learning techniques to analyze and predict house prices based on historical data.
